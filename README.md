### Objective is to create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage of rocket launch will land successfully.

**Learnings** 
* data collection through API and Web Scraping.
* Data Wrangling.
* Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL and Data Visualization.
* Machine Learning prediction using Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM’s and KNN’s.

### Confusion Matrix for the Decision Tree classifier shows it’s the best ML algorithm for this task with model accuracy 87%. And larger the flight amount at a launch site, the greater the success rate at a launch site.
